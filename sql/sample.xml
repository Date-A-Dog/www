Charlie was rescued from certain death by Tysons Pals Rescue, over a year ago and is being fostered by his Angel Ashlyn and her family in Houston, TX. I was shocked to see him. I could see every bone of his body and he his teeth were chipped eating stones when he found no food. Thanks to Ashlyn and her family, Charlie is a healthy good looking gtuy all set for his forever home.. The secret is out and he is now available for adoption. He is a sweet natured, child friendly Mastiff Mix who has be to Hell & back. We are loking for a home where Charlie is the only dog. Check out his video clip to know Charlie's journey

Description: Foxy is a female, 2 year old terrier mix weighing 6.8 lbs. She has the most precious, little face resembling a little fox. She is low-shedding. Personality and Behavior: Foxy is a shy, but a sweet girl. She will need patience and someone who will have time to help her build up her confidence and human socialization. She will make a great doggie friend. She is happiest in a pac and needs to be with another small dog, or dogs. She seems to get along with all dog and she loves to play. Other dogs love her as she is friendly and super playful. A fenced area for her to play and potty is ideal. No small children under 6 because of her being shy, but not because she would be a danger to children. She is not one bit aggressive. Fee and Policy: fee includes spay, shelter fees, vaccinations, heart worm test, microchip, health certificate, flea treatment, deworming, transportation, vet checked in CA and Seattle, collar and leash and 30 days of health insurance. $350 *We are unable to do out of state adoptions. A home safety check is required. An application can be found on our website or email us for one. We are in the matching making stage of his rescue, but by adopting her you allow us to save another at risk dog. All of our dogs are out of danger and are in foster homes. First you complete the application, then we set up meeting times. If you have any questions, please let us know. Thank You!

All of our puppies/dogs are in foster homes. For more info or to visit one you MUST call Missy @ 206-526-1558 (if you e-mail you may lose out on a puppy/dog) to arrange a meet and greet at our location on Lake City Way. All of our foster homes are local so this is generally very easy. All of our rescue dogs and puppies come with a mandatory free 6 week behavior class with Gayle Ballinger of Pawsitive Dog Steps.(If you are not in the area, obedience classes are still mandatory at your own expense) Even before they are adopted they and their foster parents generally attend classes either on the sideline or actively involved.The ultimate way to start a bond with your new friend!

OMGOSH this dog is amazing! He plays with a bullmastiff like he's a big dog and he loves cats and little boys! He definitely prefers men or boys but he has an amazing sense of humor and a great love of life and play! Give Missy a call to meet him. 206-526-1558

You can see a before and after photo of Sadie & Spencer, Sadie is on the left. Both were covered with mats fleas and ticks just week ago! Now they are sleeping in my room with me. They are wonderful sweet and loving. Sadie is a little quieter while Spencer loves to play and check things out. All of our puppies/dogs are in foster homes. For more info or to visit one you MUST call Missy @ 206-526-1558 (if you e-mail you may lose out on a puppy/dog) to arrange a meet and greet at our location on Lake City Way. All of our foster homes are local so this is generally very easy. All of our rescue dogs and puppies come with a mandatory free 6 week behavior class with Gayle Ballinger of Pawsitive Dog Steps.(If you are not in the area, obedience classes are still mandatory at your own expense) Even before they are adopted they and their foster parents generally attend classes either on the sideline or actively involved.The ultimate way to start a bond with your new friend!

Description: Pearl is a female, 5 year old maltese mix weighing 13 lbs. She is non-shedding. Pearl is part of a bonded pair. We don't plan on separating them as they love each other. Personality and Behavior: Pearl is very sweet girl. She is loving and makes a great lap dog, but at the same time she can be playful and adventurous. She is very nurturing and has taken on 4 lb Cici (a chihuahua) as her best mate. They are a perfect match and we want to keep them together. Pearl & Cici would do great with a couple or a retired person. Older kids are fine. Cici is so tiny that small children could hurt her. Fee and Policy: fee includes spay, shelter fees, vaccinations, heart worm test, microchip, health certificate, dental cleaning and work, transportation, vet checked in CA and Seattle, collar and leash $250 (their adoption fee together is $500 which has been subsidized to this lower amount by a generous donor) We are unable to do out of state adoptions. A home safety check is required. An application can be found on our website or email us for one. You must fill out an application before meeting our dogs. If you have questions beforehand, please feel free to ask. We are in the matching making stage of his rescue, but by adopting her you allow us to save another at risk dog. All of our dogs are out of danger and are in foster homes. First you complete the application, then we set up meeting times. If you have any questions, please let us know. We are an all volunteer organization doing this work for no profit for the benefit of our dogs. Thank You!

Description: Cici is a female, 5 year old chihuahua weighing 4lbs. Cici is bonded to Pearl a 5 year old maltese. They are a bonded pair that we don't plan on separating. They love each other. Personality and Behavior: Cici is a very sweet girl. She is loving and makes a great lap dog, She can be shy at first, but there is something really special about her. I swear she has the ability to connect and see into your soul. She will look at you with such gratefulness. Pearl & Cici would do great with a couple or a retired person. Older kids are fine. Cici is so tiny that small children could hurt her. Fee and Policy: fee includes spay, shelter fees, vaccinations, heart worm test, microchip, health certificate, dental cleaning and work, transportation, vet checked in CA and Seattle, collar and leash $250 (their adoption fee together is $500 which has been subsidized to this low amount by a generous donor) We are unable to do out of state adoptions. A home safety check is required. An application can be found on our website or email us for one. You must fill out an application before meeting our dogs. If you have questions beforehand, please feel free to ask. We are in the matching making stage of his rescue, but by adopting her you allow us to save another at risk dog. All of our dogs are out of danger and are in foster homes. First you complete the application, then we set up meeting times. If you have any questions, please let us know. We are an all volunteer organization doing this work for no profit for the benefit of our dogs. Thank You!

See more pictures of Quinn on her Facebook album! https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1056413807710749.1073742037.364134910271979&type=3 Meet miss Quinn! A pretty pit bull mix that will melt your heart with her big eyes and sweet personality. We estimate Quinn was born in the beginning of 2013 and she weighs about 65 pounds. We rescued Quinn on March 25th, 2015 after she was picked up as a stray and very pregnant by the Yakima Humane Society. She had her puppies in foster care and they were all adopted as soon as they were old enough, but Quinn is still waiting for her forever home to find her. According to one of her puppiesâ€™ DNA test, the pups were 1/2 American Staffordshire Terrier, 1/4 Greyhound, and 1/4 Australian Shepherd. Since we donâ€™t know what the puppiesâ€™ dad was, Quinn could be any of those three breeds. Quinn is a very sweet girl and has been doing great in her foster home. She was in a foster home with children when she had her puppies and was wonderful with them. In her foster home, Quinn is working on leash manners on walks, and she learns quickly and has wonderful manners in the house and car. She is always up for an adventure and would make a great companion for an active owner. She has some resource guarding with other dogs so she would do best in a home where she is the only dog, or with an owner who has experience with resource guarding and a very laid back canine sibling. We don't recommend Quinn go to a home with cats. Her energy level is medium, after a play session or a walk sheâ€™s content to chill around the house with you. Quinn absolutely adores her people and is such a loving little girl, she would make a fun, goofy, affectionate addition to a family. Quinn has an adoption fee of $225. All of our dogs come to their adopters spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and flea treated as needed. If you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please go to our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com to fill out an adoption application, or email forgotten.dogs.rescue@gmail.com for more information.

Meet Kenzie! This adorable little girl is the definition of a â€œpocket pit bullâ€. Weighing in at a little under 40 pounds, she could almost fit in your pocket! Kenzie initially came to us in March of 2015 when she was pregnant. She had her litter of puppies (11 of them!), and once they were weaned and found homes, she was adopted as well. Unfortunately she turned out not to be a good fit for her adopter, so she came back to us earlier this year. We estimate she was born around September 2013. Kenzie is doing wonderfully in her foster home and is ready to find her perfect adopter! Donâ€™t let Kenzieâ€™s tiny size and adorable face fool you, this girl has a stubborn streak! Her ideal home will provide her with structure and boundaries, and she does best with a firm, calm and confident handler. When she has this, sheâ€™s a delightful little dog! Kenzie gets along well with the other dogs in her foster home, but can be a little bundle of bossy! If she goes to a home with another dog, the dog should ideally be more laid back and easy going. Kenzie just loves her people! She would prefer to be pet all day long. She is food motivated and fairly smart, so she might convince you to give her more treats than she needs ;) She will take those treats very gently as well. She is incredibly sweet and outgoing with most, but can be a little shy with men when first meeting. Kenzie has a special relationship with garden hoses. Whenever it is on it's a game of eat the spray! This has given her foster mom countless hours of laughter! Kenzie has luxating patellas in her hind legs, but theyâ€™re minor and donâ€™t seem to cause her any discomfort, so our veterinarian recommended simply keeping her at a healthy weight. Kenzie is crate trained and house trained. Are you looking to add a sweet little girl with tons of personality to your home? Let us know! Kenzie has an adoption fee of $225. All of our dogs come to their adopters spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and flea treated as needed. If you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please go to our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com to fill out an adoption application, or email forgotten.dogs.rescue@gmail.com for more information.

See more pictures of Ryder on his Facebook album! https://www.facebook.com/forgottendogsrescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1278982622120532 Meet Ryder! Ryder came to us in May as an owner surrender, and he is looking for a human to call his own! This boy was born in July of 2013 and he weighs 75 pounds. His previous owners adopted him from a shelter where he had spent many months waiting for a home, but they had to give him up because Ryder didn't like the men in that home. However, Ryder had done well with all people he has been introduced to with his foster family. His fosters have introduced him to many different people, including lots of men, and he has shown no reactivity towards any of them. In his new home, proper introductions to new people to avoid the problems he previously had will be a must. Ryder lives with 4 canine siblings, two of which are FDR alumni, and sleeps with his foster dad every night. While it has taken some patience for all of the dogs to get along, Ryder absolutely loves one of his siblings and they could play all day long if allowed. Ryder has gotten his AKC Canine Good Citizen Certificate and his fosters have done a wonderful job with training. Ryder is very strong and can a little stubborn, so he needs a home that will continue to give him structure and boundaries. He will also a need strong, firm, calm, and confident handler with willingness to continue to work with him to get him where he has gotten with his foster home. Ryder is sweet boy with lots of love to give and with a little patience and guidance, he is a great boy. While he does great with his foster siblings, Ryder would do be best either as an only dog or with an appropriate canine companion. Heâ€™s very active and loves to play, so a submissive, laid back dog who likes to play is ideal. Ryder is incredibly loving and will make an amazing companion for the right person. He had a tough start to life but with a little guidance from his foster parents, he is doing wonderfully and is ready to find a forever home. Ryder is crate trained, house trained, and his fosters are consistently working on basic obedience training with him. He is chipped, neutered and vaccinated. His adoption fee is $225. If you are interested in adopting this sweet boy, please fill out an application at www.forgottendogsrescue.com

See more pictures of Mika on her Facebook album! https://www.facebook.com/forgottendogsrescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1313075618711232 Meet Mika! (Pronounced Meeka). Stop, collaborate and listen! Mika is still single and ready to mingle. Are you looking for a lovely little gal to share your life, and couch with? If so, then Mika may just be the girl for you! She was bailed out from the Yakima Humane Society in early August after spending three long months in there waiting for a human of her very own. We estimate that Mika was born in May of 2015, and weighs about 55 pounds. When she left the shelter, Mika had demodex mange, which caused hair loss around her eyes, but with lots of love and a little TLC, that is no longer an issue. Sweet Mika is currently in a wonderful foster home where she resides with multiple canine foster siblings, and while she can get a little over stimulated, she's pretty amazing overall with them. While she is good with other large dogs, Mika would do best in a home with no small animals. Mika is the sweetest girl with lots of love to give and with a little patience and guidance, she will be the most amazing dog on the block! Mika is a sweet, loving girl who wants nothing more than to please you and snuggle with you. She knows basic commands, is house trained, crate trained. Mika also loves walks and is learning to walk like a graceful little lady on a leash. She will flourish in a patient home that will continue her obedience training. She wants nothing more than to please you and if you give her your heart, sheâ€™ll give you hers! Little Miss Mika is chipped, spayed and vaccinated. her adoption fee is $225. If you think you're ready for her jelly and make this bootylicious girl a part of your life, then hop on to forgottendogsrescue.com and fill out application. Mika is ready to find the one, and it could very well be you, so what are you waiting for you? She can't wait to meet you!!! Mika's adoption fee is $225. All of our dogs come to their adopters spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and flea treated as needed. If you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please go to our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com to fill out an adoption application, or email forgotten.dogs.rescue@gmail.com for more information.

Kingston is a very sweet 6 month old puppy. He will wrap his paws around your neck and hug you. He was one of the calmest dogs in the litter that were born on Easter. His mom is a maltese poodle mix. His dad ...most likely a terrier. He is going to be on the large size of small around 16-18 lbs when full grown. He does not shed. Kingston had an unfortunate experience with kids, so he is nervous around children and can become nippy. We are not placing him with kids, or in a family that has small grandkids under 14. We have come to learn that Kingston is not happy being an only dog. He is not meant to be an alpha. He wants to blend into the pack and is very happy with the two dogs he is being fostered with. He can be fearful of men and new people coming into the house. His foster mom and dad have made leaps and bounds progress with him. However, if there is a man in the house, he will need to win Kingston's trust. It can be done since his foster dad has won him over! Kingston prefers women and especially motherly, or soft spoken, feminine women. He senses if you are a dog lover and responds accordingly too. The great news after sharing all of this, is that Kingston is only 6 months old. He has tons of potential in the right hands. What we are looking for: His adopter should have a fenced yard and have the time to be with him. He also needs doggie friends. He is very playful and loves to run and play with his doggie buddies. He will need an experienced owner that has lots of love and patience. His adopter will need to be willing to help him overcome his fear and let him be the goofy puppy he wants to be. The perfect environment will be calm, nurturing and loving. Fee/ What is included: All vaccinations, deworming, microchip, neuter, $395 We do not allow out of state adoptions. What to expect: We have an applications process, so please email us for an application, or copy one from our website. All of our dogs are in foster homes, so after we receive applications, we are matchmaking. We set up appointments to meet. Please be in a position to adopt and be ready since we are all volunteers with busy lives. Home safety checks are required. Thank You!

Meet Pepper, a very playful and spunky pitbull mix! She was born in February 2016, is approximately 45lbs, and has the puppy spirit! She was originally in a home with a family who did not have much time for her, where she spent a lot of time in a crate by herself. She is now in a foster home where she is starting to learn the basics of training, such as leash skills, not jumping, and appropriate play with other dogs. She LOVES to play with other dogs, has a young puppy play style, and is very submissive. Her ideal canine companion would be playful but also tolerant of her puppy energy. She is super friendly and loves everybody she meets. She is crate trained but her adopters will need to continue working on her with basic training and manners. Pepper will come to her adopters spayed, microchipped, and vaccinated, and dewormed. If you are interested in adopting this beautiful girl, please fill out an application at forgottendogsrescue.com.

See more pictures of Stan on his Facebook album! https://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.1075606915791438.1073742043.364134910271979&type=3 Meet Stan! Stan is a sweet and gentle pit bull mix looking for his forever home. We estimate he was born around 2010 and he weighs about 75 pounds. Stan has had a rough beginning and no dog deserves to find their perfect forever home more than this special boy. Stan initially entered an eastern Washington shelter in July 2014 and waited 9 long months to finally leave living in a cage behind. He was adopted in April 2015, but unfortunately he turned out not to be the right fit for the home. His adopters didnâ€™t want him to go back to a shelter, so they asked us for help. We took him into foster care on July 15, 2015. He was adopted to a great home in December 2015, but unfortunately after some time with his adopters he began displaying increased anxiety in their living environment, which was a townhouse, and they decided Stan would be happier in a quieter home. We took him back into foster care in July 2016. Since being back in his foster home, Stan has been doing fantastic and has settled right back in. Stan is a super mellow guy and gets along great with the female dogs in his foster home. He is a very endearing dog with a big sensitive soul. One of the biggest issues Stanâ€™s previous adopters have encountered is that he can display some dog reactivity on leash with certain handlers. Poor Stan can be unsure and nervous when seeing other dogs out in public and when on walks, and his response is to bark and be reactive toward them. He is wonderful with a calm and confident handler, who reassures him that he will be protected and not need to worry. Stan would be fine in a home with female dogs, but we recommend he not go to a home with other male dogs. Stan is house trained and has good manners. He just wants to be with his people and wants to please. He does have some separation anxiety, so would do best in a home where he isn't left alone much, and/or with a very sturdy crate when he is left alone. In his foster home he is crated in a Pro Select Empire kennel and he is very comfortable in it and fine being left home alone in it. Stan is truly an incredible dog who has had a run of bad luck. He is extremely mellow, loving and calm when in his foster home and just wants to curl up with his people and be loved. His foster has nicknamed him â€œEeyoreâ€ because he just looks at you with his sad eyes and itâ€™s clear he just wants to find his special person. Itâ€™s been two years since Stan first entered a shelter, itâ€™s time he gets his happily ever after and finds his forever home! Stan has an adoption fee of $225. All of our dogs come to their adopters spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and flea treated as needed. If you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please go to our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com to fill out an adoption application, or email forgotten.dogs.rescue@gmail.com for more information.

If interested in adopting Captain please fill out an application from our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com Captain has an adoption fee of $350. Meet Captain! He and his sister Crunch are pitbull mixed puppies estimated to be born mid July 2016 that were dumped as strays in Yakima.

They are very sweet, loving puppies and will make a lovely addition to a home. Captain has a very sweet temperament. He is one of the quietest puppies his foster mom has ever had! He is outgoing and gets so excited to see people. When his foster mommy comes home from work he just wants to cuddle and give lots of kisses! Captain and his sister are two very happy puppies that have stellar easy going personalities. Captain is in a foster home with cats and other dogs. Captain and his sister are well socialized with adult dogs and also puppies from a different litter. Captain is neutered, has received age appropriate vaccinations, is microchipped, and dewormed.

Eddie is super sweet and keep up with a dog 100 times his size although he's still not crazy about getting his feet wet when it's raining. All of our puppies/dogs are in foster homes. For more info or to visit one you MUST call Missy @ 206-526-1558 (if you e-mail you may lose out on a puppy/dog) to arrange a meet and greet at our location on Lake City Way. All of our foster homes are local so this is generally very easy. All of our rescue dogs and puppies come with a mandatory free 6 week behavior class with Gayle Ballinger of Pawsitive Dog Steps.(If you are not in the area, obedience classes are still mandatory at your own expense) Even before they are adopted they and their foster parents generally attend classes either on the sideline or actively involved.The ultimate way to start a bond with your new friend!

Her name is LuLu until some one comes up with a better one(feel free to give us ideas) From a home with too many dogs. So amazingly sweet, good for a family or a personal pet. Call Missy to meet this gem of a girl 206-526-1558 She is the traditional cocker size in structure. She is about 8 years old but healthy as a horse and her teeth are great. She really looks and acts like a teenage dog, amazingly smart and devoted. She is great with kids. All of our puppies/dogs are in foster homes. For more info or to visit one you MUST call Missy @ 206-526-1558 (if you e-mail you may lose out on a puppy/dog) to arrange a meet and greet at our location on Lake City Way. All of our foster homes are local so this is generally very easy. All of our rescue dogs and puppies come with a mandatory free 6 week behavior class with Gayle Ballinger of Pawsitive Dog Steps.(If you are not in the area, obedience classes are still mandatory at your own expense) Even before they are adopted they and their foster parents generally attend classes either on the sideline or actively involved.The ultimate way to start a bond with your new friend!

See more pictures of Cali on her Facebook album! https://www.facebook.com/forgottendogsrescue/photos/?tab=album&album_id=1366910649994395 Cali is a very sweet and loving pit bull looking for her forever home. Cali was born in October 2014 so she's two years old now and she weighs 70 pounds. When her previous owners had to move and couldn't take her with them, they didn't want her to go to a shelter and surrendered her to us. They had rescued her off of Craigslist the year before and said she might have been abused in the home she was in previously, as she would often cower to the ground whenever she was unsure. Cali is a sensitive girl and as sweet as they come. She can be fearful and unsure in new situations and when she first came to her foster home, poor girl didn't even want to walk into the house, her foster mom had to lure her in with treats! We were so glad she didn't go to the shelter as she would have had a very hard time there. Within a few days in her foster home though she settled in and came out of her shell. Cali loves her people and is a wonderful cuddler. Sheâ€™s so happy to be curled up next to you getting petted. With a proper introduction she does well with other dogs and is living with several other dogs in her foster home. She does seem to fixate a bit on smaller dogs so we recommend she go to a home with larger dogs. Because she can be a little nervous, her ideal canine companion is more confident and outgoing. She loves to play with her foster siblings! In her previous home she lived with two young boys ages 6 and 8 and was great with them. Cali is crate trained, knows basic commands (and several tricks!), is great in the car, and LOVES playing in sprinklers and with the hose. Cali is very responsive, eager to please, and just wants to make her person happy. She will thrive in a patient and loving home that will continue to build her confidence. Are you looking for a sweet, loving, and devoted dog who will be your constant companion? Caliâ€™s your girl! Cali has an adoption fee of $350. All of our dogs come to their adopters spayed/neutered, vaccinated, microchipped, dewormed, and flea treated as needed. If you are interested in adopting one of our dogs, please go to our website www.forgottendogsrescue.com to fill out an adoption application, or email forgotten.dogs.rescue@gmail.com for more information.

Ravyn is an energetic, playful female who is looking for her forever family. Petite at 48#, Ravyn is rambunctious, happy, and fun- always up for lifeâ€™s next adventure! Whether she is playing hide and seek with her toys, or working on her basic obedience training, Ravyn is focused and always busy. In her foster home, Ravyn has mastered a handful of commands (sit, crate, outside, inside, come here, out, off, no, climb, upstairs, downstairs and "go find your ball") and is currently working on down and shake. With continued leadership, she can overcome her intermittent reactivity towards other dogs and people. She walks nicely on a leash and is extremely athletic, making her an ideal candidate for a very active home. A striking black Malinois, Ravyn loves to be a part of a family. While she has been with three human children in her foster home, she tends to be wary of quick movements, so Ravyn would be more comfortable in a home with dog-savvy children over twelve years of age. Brave and curious, Ravyn has gotten along well with her two foster siblings, both adult male shepherds. While she initially presents herself as a dominant female, Ravyn is quick to retreat to a less dominant position and will respect an existing dominance hierarchy in a home. Because she tends to steal toys from other dogs and her initially dominant presence can be misinterpreted, Ravyn is best suited for a home with male siblings. Although Ravyn is young at around 11 months old, she is fully house trained and does well with a structured daily routine and can be left in her crate for a few hours at a time. At night, Ravyn sleeps quietly in her crate. With recent 4th of July celebrations, she remained focused and un-phased by the bright lights and loud noises. With her busy nature, Ravyn would be best suited for a family who could engage, focus and mold her endless energy in a positive way. Whether it be hiking, daily jogs in the park, or agility, little Ravyn is up for the challenge! Contact the Woof Project today to learn more about this very unique and special girl. Ravyn is in foster in the Seattle, WA area WEST COAST ADOPTIONS ONLY Must have previous or current, purebred Malinois experience OR other high drive working breed experience. Our adoption process includes- completion of an application, followed by a telephone interview. If that goes well, we will arrange for a home visit. Adoption Fee: $325.00. Transport along Interstate 5 is available but cost not included in adoption fee.
